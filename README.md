# shopping-spa
A custom built Vanilla-JS shopping-cart SPA.

Very little was used to build this app, as I mainly used this as an excuse to learn vanilla JS and OOP.

Things learnt:
===================
- Managing and matching data and DOM is a pain, and creating elements without JSX is also painful

Mistakes (that are too hard to fix this far in):
===================
â€“ The Cart class perhaps doesn't adhere to the SRP rule of SOLID
